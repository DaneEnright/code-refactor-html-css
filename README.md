# <Horiseon Refactoring HTML and CSS>

## Description

Built this project to get more familiar with HTML and CSS as well as learn how to upload my work to GitHub.

This was a refactoring assignment where we looked at someone elses code and made it more accessible and cleaned up.

Learned a lot about these html and css languages and how they work together. Also how to do a small form of debugging someone elses code.
